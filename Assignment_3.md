I agree with the statement that

People haven't to watch TV in the future.

First, TV is not portable.

This is because, It is not carrying anywhere.

so we cann't watch whenever want.

Second, TV is comming better technologies.

For instance, People can watch all the contents with smartphone.

I disagree whi the statement that

Entertainer is good model to children.

First, Entertainer is unrealistic standard.

To be specific, if young people are not achieve,

they will be low self-esteem

Second, Sometimes, Entertainer can behave imappropriately.

this is because, Young people don't know what is good behavior as well

so they they will see and copy anything.

I agree with the statement that

The process is more important that the result.

First, People learn something from the process.

This is because, we trial and error through

we can gain experience to use next.

Second, we are more experimental.

For example, if i focus on a goal,

i will have narrow thinking.
