### Speaking assignments

> I prefer to go to school for 10 months per year.
```
First, Students need breaks.

To be specific, they are stressed due to schoolwork.
so their brain needs time to relex, (refresh)
if they release their stress effectively by something,
they (will) learn to study better.

Second, Students are important for persnal development.

For example, If they have a time to volunteer, playing sports,
and traveling, it will get various experiences and skills
and they will help to have a head start in a job market.
(= this will help them to have a head start in a job market. )
```

> I prefer choosing  (a?) one major.
```
First, Students (can?) have a specialized knowledge.

This is because, if they focus one area,
they will learn deeply.
They are helpful when they get a job

Second, Students (can?) enable to do extracurricular activites.

To be specific, they have (a?) more time to devote
to other things so they can broaden their perspective.
```

> I prefer doing assignment (on?) bit by bit.
```
First, I won't be overwhelmed

For instance, if i do (a?) assignment for 1 or 2 days,
i will rush it and also my assignment will be failed.
so it won't be helpful to learn to my course.

Second, if i do assignment bit by bit, it will be better quality.

To be specific, i have more time to devote to doing assignment,
i have time to revise and polish each section

As a result, i'm helpful to enhance my grades.

> I agree with the statement that
> children have to do a homework alone since elemantary school.
```
First, Children become mature.

This is because, they need to learn to handle own responsibility.
therefore, they are helpful to grow up in life

Second, Children learn to be fair.

For instance, if other people help them,
they do not earn grade honestly
and they forget to learn quickly.
