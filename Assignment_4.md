# Day 4

> ## Assignments handed in late should receive penalties.
```
I agree with the statement that
Assignments handed in late should receive penalties.

First, Teachers know capacity of students.

This is because, theachers give students assignments that they can do it during enough time.

Second, Students get motivated it.

To be specific, If they didn't do assignments, they won't get motivated.

they put more effort if they give penalties.

As a result, they are helpful to get good grades.
```
> ## Childhood is the happiest time in life?
```
I disagree with the statement that
Childhood is the happiest time in life

First, Adults are the happiest time.

This is because, They know what is happy

such as Drinking beer, Driving, and Spending the whole night talking with friends.

Second, Children are expressed by their parents.

To be specific, if their parents are bad, children are left bad memory.
```
> ## Children should not have cell phones.
```
I agree with the statement that
Children should not have cell phones.

First, Their parents can spend in persnal time.

For instance, if family eat out,
their parent can eat comfortable
because their children focus smartphone.

Second, Children don't play game everytime.

To be specific, children use smartphone for studying

for example, my nephew studied about cooking by smartphone

so I could eat his delicious food.
```
> ## Companies should ban employees from sending personal emails and texts during work hours.

```
I agree with the statment that
Companies should ban employees 
from sending personal emails and texts during work hours.

First, you can focus your work.
This is because, I read some magagine about time that employees really focus on working.
The magagine said they can almost finish work before noon.
so they can be helpful their project better

Second, you can usually go home without overtime

To be specific, I have usually focused to work
and only talked with co-workers about a project
so I have gone home without overtime.
```
> ## It is better to be a friend with the one who is similaryly aged or with the one who is much older?
```
I prefer to be a friend with the one who is much older.

First, I can recieve good advices.

This is because, Older friend have been more various experiences than I.
so they can give diverse experiences.

Second, My friends who is similary can fight.

To be specific, they can have been less experiences than I.
if i want to earn a advice when i have a issue but my friend hasn't been an experience,
he will give a bad advice then i will be in a difficult situation.
