> ## Assignments handed in late should receive penalties.

I agree with the statement that
Assignments handed in late should receive penalties.

First, Teachers know capacity of students.

This is because, theachers give students assignments that they can do it during enough time.

Second, Students get motivated it.

To be specific, If they didn't do assignments, they won't get motivated.

they put more effort if they give penalties.

As a result, they are helpful to get good grades.

> ## Childhood is the happiest time in life?

I disagree with the statement that
Childhood is the happiest time in life

First, Adults are the happiest time.

This is because, They know what is happy

such as Drinking beer, Driving, and Spending the whole night talking with friends.

Second, Children are expressed by their parents.

To be specific, if their parents are bad, children are left bad memory.

> ## Children should not have cell phones.

I agree with the statement that
Children should not have cell phones.

First, Their parents can spend in persnal time.

For instance, if family eat out,
their parent can eat comfortable
because their children focus smartphone.

Second, Children don't play game everytime.

To be specific, children use smartphone for studying

for example, my nephew studied about cooking by smartphone

so I could eat his delicious food.
